This code runs Peng and Wei's kmeans SDP [4] (using SDPNAL+ [5]) and 
Matlab's built in kmeans++ version of Lloyd's algorithm on NMIST data [2] 
previously preprocessed using TensorFlow [1] (mapped into feature space and
saved in './data/data_features.mat'). 

It prints out a numerical comparison and produces the graphs in [3].

The python script generate_data.py uses TensorFlow to create the feature
data and saves it in './data/data_features.mat'. It is not necessary to run
since data is already present but we include the code for completeness.

*****
Requires CVX and SDPNAL+.

Note: CVX is only required for running misclassification.m which is not
critic for this experiment.

*****
How to run
Run main.m (in Matlab or Octave). Not tested in Octave
